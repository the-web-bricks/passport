# Rain (Work-In-Progress)

A blazing fast and scalable unique ID generator written in pure go 🚀💥

## Algorithm

```
The IDs generated by this sequence generator are composed of -

__Epoch timestamp__ in milliseconds precision - 42 bits.
  The maximum timestamp that can be represented using 42 bits is 242 - 1, or 4398046511103, which comes out to be Wednesday, May 15, 2109 7:35:11.103 AM. That gives us 139 years with respect to a custom epoch.
__Node ID__ - 10 bits. This gives us 1024 nodes/machines.
__Local counter per machine__ - 12 bits. The counter’s max value would be 4095.
```
